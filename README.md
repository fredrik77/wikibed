# wikibed
It ain't much yet, but the idea is to build a set of angular controllers to make it easier to embed mediawiki
(or any other wiki release compatible) on a webpage.

So far all it can do is take an article from a mediawiki (once Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Origin: is set correctly)
Our idea is mainly to allow you to use mediawiki as a document retrival system then add some extra wawawoom using things like bootstrap or whatever css magic you want.
